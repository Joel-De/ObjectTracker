# ObjectTracker

Pretty basic OpenMV script to identify an april tag (I glued the tag onto an object) and get those co-ordinates, many examples available online.
I took those co-ordinates and connected them to a hobby servo motor that you can get at pretty much any hardware store, and got it to follow it around pretty easily, I have a 2 Axis version that will be coming soon using a simple design I put together in about an hour
