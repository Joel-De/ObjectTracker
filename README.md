# ObjectTracker

Here’s an example of and older version working, pardon the messy room I'd been working on this for a couple days before getting it to work properly, good news is once you understand it, it's fairly easy to get good results.

Below are what the early prototype stages looked like, back with color tracking which I couldn’t do due to the low resolution and general poor ability of the camera being able to adapt to light

Pretty basic OpenMV script to identify an April tag (I glued the tag onto an object) and get those co-ordinates, many examples available online.
I took those co-ordinates and connected them to a hobby servo motor that you can get at pretty much any hardware store, and got it to follow it around pretty easily, I have a 2 Axis version that will be coming soon using a simple design I put together in about an hour

Here’s what the early design looked like
